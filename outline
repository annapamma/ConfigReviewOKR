- Installs custom packages: may want to consider building a custom docker image
- Persists the entire workspace directory
We have checks for whether or not concurrent jobs tried to persist the same files, and those grow more expensive with more files persisted.
- Parallelizing unwisely
- Not using a fallback key
- Not using secrets
- Not using an AWS deploy orb


Advanced features
Build - Test on different executors - Manual approval step - Deploy to AWS

- Using multi-stage builds for a small custom Docker image
- Reusable parts of config (commands, executors)
- Using multiple orbs (Slack for manual approval, deploy to AWS)
- Encrypting secrets in the config
